This repository contains Python code for a trained model that detects and classifies currency notes. Follow the steps below to set up and use the project.

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Collect the Dataset
   - Gather a dataset of currency notes, ensuring it contains images in appropriate formats (e.g., `.jpg` or `.png`).
   - Organize the dataset into separate folders for each class (e.g., `10-rupees`, `20-rupees`, etc.) to facilitate training.

### 2. Update the Dataset Path
   - Update the code to point to the dataset path on your system.
   - Ensure the dataset is correctly structured and accessible for the training process.

### 3. Train and Fine-Tune the Model
   - Run the training script to train the model on the collected dataset.
   - Fine-tune the model using appropriate hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Usage
   - Once trained, the model can be used to classify images of currency notes.
   - Refer to the code comments for details on inference and evaluation.

## Notes
   - Make sure to install all required dependencies as mentioned in the `requirements.txt`.
   - Adjust the dataset size and model architecture based on your computational resources.

Feel free to open issues or contribute to improving the model!
